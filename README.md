# Project Title: Simple HTML to PDF Conversion Example

## Description

This repository contains a simple example demonstrating how to use the `html2pdf.js` library to generate PDF files from an HTML file within a React application. It showcases the integration of `html2pdf.js` with React, allowing users to easily convert HTML content to PDF documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ninjonik/ReactHTML2PDF.git
cd ReactHTML2PDF
```
2. Install the required dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server.
```bash
npm start
```


## Usage

After running the development server, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. Here, you will see a simple interface with a heading and a paragraph. Clicking the "Convert to PDF" button will trigger the conversion process, generating a PDF document named 'my-document.pdf' based on the HTML content displayed.
